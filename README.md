# Krisibal – AI-Driven Smart Farming Platform

**Empowering Indian farmers with accessible, multilingual AI tools for better decision-making and profitability.**

Krisibal is a comprehensive AI platform designed specifically for smallholder farmers in India. It provides agriculture-related decision support **in local languages** (e.g., Hindi, Telugu, and regional dialects), combining computer vision for crop monitoring, NLP-powered chatbots for instant advice, real-time data integrations, and community features to help reduce crop losses and improve income.

Developed as a personal/academic project by **Aman Raj** (B.Tech CSE, GITAM University) to address key challenges in rural agriculture, such as limited access to timely information and market opportunities.
